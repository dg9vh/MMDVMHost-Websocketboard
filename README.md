# MMDVMHost-Websocketboard## IntroductionThis is a very first development version of my new MMDVMDash using websockets-technology to get rid of high load on Raspberry Pi and others and keep those temperature down.Also this should improve user experience.## Technical DetailsThe Dashboard persists in detail in 3 components: two on the server (Hotspot/Repeater) side and on on the browser.The two server sided components are the logtailer.py (which communicates via websocket with your browser and streams the logs to it for processing) and the webserver-component from python3 (which is serving the needed html and javascript infrastructure to your browser).The client based component is the javascript processing the streamed log lines and filling the tables.## Used PortsBy default following Ports are used for running the Dashboard:* 8000 TCP: webservice* 5678 TCP: Websocket## InstallationYou'll need to install several python3 modules. A concrete list will follow here later.Actually known:* websockets: `sudo apt install python3-websockets`* ansi2html: `sudo pip3 install ansi2html`### Reommendations* take care to set Loglevel for FileLevel = 2 in your MMDVM.ini### Installation steps* clone this repository to your home-directory with `git clone --recurse-submodules -j8 https://github.com/dg9vh/MMDVMHost-Websocketboard` to clone the repository with it's submodules* create directory with `sudo mkdir /opt/MMDVMDash`* change ownership to your user for example with `sudo chown -R pi /opt/MMDVMDash`* copy all files from repository into this folder* modify *logtailer.ini* to fit your needs* modify */html/js/config.js* to fit your needs, here you can switch on/off tabs showing or enable debug for getting some output in javascript console* copy files in */opt/MMDVMDash/systemd* to */etc/systemd/system* or similar corresponding to your system* modify both scripts to fit your needs* enable services with following commmands, this results in starting both automatically after reboot:  * `sudo systemctl enable http.server.service`  * `sudo systemctl enable logtailer.service`* start services with following commmands:  * `sudo systemctl start http.server.service`  * `sudo systemctl start logtailer.service`Finally you should be able to get the new Dashboard calling the hostname of your hotspot and port 8000 (default) in your broser## Credits*logtailer.py* is based on the work of http://shzhangji.com/blog/2017/07/15/log-tailer-with-websocket-and-python/## Screenshots![Screenshot of MMDVMDash Websocketboard](img/Screenshot.png "Screenshot of MMDVMDash Websocketboard")
